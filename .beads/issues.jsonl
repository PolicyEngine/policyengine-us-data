Age, filing status, and number of dependents are strong predictors of 401(k) participation and contribution rates. Adding these should improve the distributional accuracy.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-31T08:01:22.72749-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-31T08:08:02.675063-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-31T08:08:02.675063-05:00"}
