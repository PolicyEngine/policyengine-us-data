# Introduction

PolicyEngine-US-Data is a package that creates representative microdata for the US, 
designed for input in the PolicyEngine tax-benefit microsimulation model. This tool 
allows users to explore the data sources, validation processes, and enhancements 
made to ensure accurate and reliable microsimulation results.

PolicyEngine is a tool with a clear purpose: for given assumptions about US government policy and US households, predicting what US households will look like in the next few years. To do that, we need both of two things:

* An accurate model of the effects of policy rules on households.
* An accurate representation of the current US household sector *now*.

This repository is dedicated to the second of those. In this documentation, we'll explain how we do that, but we'll also use our model (the first bullet) to see what we end up with when we combine the two, and measure up against other organisations doing the same thing.
