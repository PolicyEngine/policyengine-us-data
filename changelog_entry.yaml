  changes:
    added:
    - Census-block-first calibration pipeline (calibration/ package) ported from PR #516
    - Clone-and-assign module for population-weighted census block sampling
    - Unified matrix builder with clone-by-clone simulation, COO caching, and target_overview-based querying
    - Unified calibration CLI with L0 optimization and seeded takeup re-randomization
    - 28 new tests for the calibration pipeline
    removed:
    - SparseMatrixBuilder, MatrixTracer, and fit_calibration_weights (replaced by unified pipeline)
    - 8 old SparseMatrixBuilder-dependent tests (replaced by new test_calibration suite)
