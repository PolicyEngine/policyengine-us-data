- bump: minor
  changes:
    added:
    - Entity aware target calculations for correct entity counts.
    - Selection of targets closest to calibration time period and uprating logic for cohesive and comprehensive time-period coverage.
    - Hierarchical state-level uprating with CD reconciliation via hierarchy inconsistency factors (HIFs) and state-specific uprating factors (e.g., CMS/KFF ACA PTC multipliers).
    - stratum_domain and target_overview views for easier target inspection and debugging.
    - test_schema_views_and_lookups.py for testing the new views and lookups.
    - Calibration matrix diagnostic notebook (docs/calibration_matrix.ipynb).
    removed:
    - Redundant database fields and tables (variable_groups, variable_metadata,sources, source_id, stratum_group_id).
