- bump: minor
  changes:
    added:
    - Census-block-first calibration pipeline (calibration/ package) ported from PR #516
    - Clone-and-assign module for population-weighted census block sampling
    - Unified matrix builder with clone-by-clone simulation, COO caching, and target_overview-based querying
    - Unified calibration CLI with L0 optimization and seeded takeup re-randomization
    - 28 new tests for the calibration pipeline
    - Integration test for build_matrix geographic masking (national/state/CD)
    - Tests for drop_target_groups utility
    - voluntary_filing.yaml takeup rate parameter
    changed:
    - Rewrote local_area_calibration_setup.ipynb for clone-based pipeline
    - Renamed _get_geo_level to get_geo_level (now cross-module public API)
    fixed:
    - Fix Jupyter import error in unified_calibration.py (OutStream.reconfigure moved to main)
    - Fix modal_app/remote_calibration_runner.py referencing deleted fit_calibration_weights.py
    - Fix _coo_parts stale state bug on build_matrix re-call after failure
    - Remove hardcoded voluntary_filing rate in favor of YAML parameter
    removed:
    - SparseMatrixBuilder, MatrixTracer, and fit_calibration_weights (replaced by unified pipeline)
    - 8 old SparseMatrixBuilder-dependent tests (replaced by new test_calibration suite)
