- bump: minor
  changes:
    added:
    - PUF clone + QRF imputation module (puf_impute.py) with state_fips predictor and stratified subsample preserving top 0.5% by AGI
    - ACS re-imputation module (source_impute.py) with state predictor; SIPP/SCF imputation without state (surveys lack state identifiers)
    - PUF and source impute integration into unified calibration pipeline (--puf-dataset, --skip-puf, --skip-source-impute flags)
    - 21 new tests for puf_impute and source_impute modules
    - DC_STATEHOOD=1 environment variable set in storage/__init__.py to ensure DC is included in state-based processing
    changed:
    - Refactored extended_cps.py to delegate to puf_impute.puf_clone_dataset() (443 -> 75 lines)
    - PUF QRF training uses stratified subsample (20K target) instead of random subsample(10_000), force-including high-income tail
    - unified_calibration.py pipeline now supports optional source imputation and PUF cloning steps
