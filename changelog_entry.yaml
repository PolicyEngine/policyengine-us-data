- bump: minor
  changes:
    added:
    - Support for health_insurance_premiums_without_medicare_part_b in local area calibration
    changed:
    - Removed dense reweighting path from enhanced CPS; only sparse (L0) weights are produced
    - Eliminated TEST_LITE and LOCAL_AREA_CALIBRATION flags; all datasets generated unconditionally
    - Merged data-local-area Makefile target into data target
    removed:
    - Redundant test_sparse_matrix_builder.py (tests consolidated in test_matrix_national_variation.py)
    - Redundant build_calibration_matrix.py (functionality in fit_calibration_weights.py)
    fixed:
    - Versioning workflow now runs uv lock after version bump to keep uv.lock in sync
