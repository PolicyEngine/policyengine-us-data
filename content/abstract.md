# Abstract

We present a methodology for creating enhanced microsimulation datasets by combining the Current Population Survey (CPS) with the IRS Public Use File (PUF). Our two-stage approach uses quantile regression forests to impute 72 tax variables from the PUF onto CPS records, preserving distributional characteristics while maintaining household structure. We then apply a reweighting algorithm that calibrates the dataset to over 7,000 targets from six sources: IRS Statistics of Income, Census population projections, Congressional Budget Office program estimates, Treasury expenditure data, Joint Committee on Taxation tax expenditure estimates, and healthcare spending patterns. The reweighting employs dropout-regularized gradient descent optimization to ensure consistency with administrative benchmarks. The dataset maintains the CPS's demographic detail and geographic granularity while incorporating tax reporting data from administrative sources. We release the enhanced dataset, source code, and documentation to support policy analysis.
