## The Microsimulation Landscape

Tax and benefit microsimulation models play a crucial role in policy analysis by projecting the distributional and revenue impacts of proposed reforms. Major institutions maintaining these models include the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis (OTA), and the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center (TPC). Each model serves specific institutional needs but faces common data challenges.

The core challenges these models face stem from the fundamental tradeoff between data comprehensiveness and accessibility. Administrative tax data provides accurate income reporting but lacks the household context needed to model benefit programs and analyze family-level impacts (Sabelhaus and Johnson, 2020). Survey data captures household relationships and program participation but suffers from income underreporting that worsens at higher income levels (Meyer et al., 2021). The need to protect taxpayer privacy further limits data availability, as administrative microdata cannot be publicly released.

Each existing model approaches these challenges with different tradeoffs. The JCT model emphasizes tax precision using administrative data but has limited capacity to analyze transfer programs or state taxes (Joint Committee on Taxation, 2015). The CBO combines survey and administrative sources through statistical matching but cannot release their enhanced microdata (Congressional Budget Office, 2022). The Tax Policy Center developed imputation methods but relies on a proprietary extract of tax returns unavailable to outside researchers (Rohaly et al., 2005). These limitations create barriers for academic researchers, state governments, and policy organizations seeking to conduct their own analyses.

Our enhanced dataset addresses these institutional needs in several ways. For government agencies like CBO and Treasury, our open-source methodology provides a transparent alternative that could supplement or validate their internal models. The dataset's state identifiers and calibration to state-level targets enables state revenue departments to analyze federal-state tax interactions. Academic researchers gain access to data suitable for analyzing both tax and transfer policies without restrictive data use agreements. Policy organizations can use the enhanced dataset with PolicyEngine or other microsimulation models to provide rapid analysis of reform proposals.

The integration of our dataset with the broader microsimulation ecosystem offers several advantages. The open-source nature promotes methodological transparency and peer review, addressing concerns about "black box" models in policy analysis. The modular design allows researchers to substitute alternative imputation or calibration methods while maintaining the overall framework. Regular updates as new CPS and administrative data become available ensure the dataset remains current. Most importantly, the public availability democratizes access to high-quality microsimulation capabilities previously restricted to well-resourced institutions.
