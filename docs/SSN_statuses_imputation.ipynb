    "# Imputing SSN statuses\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation outlines the implementation of SSN status imputation within the Enhanced CPS dataset, using the ASEC Undocumented Algorithm. The ASEC Undocumented Algorithm applies a process-of-elimination method to identify likely undocumented individuals in the CPS. It systematically removes people with clear evidence of legal immigration status, such as U.S. citizenship, lawful permanent residence, or work-authorized visas. Those remaining are flagged as likely undocumented and assigned an SSN card type accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enhanced CPS dataset incorporates this imputation to improve accuracy in microsimulation analysis. This includes modelling eligibility and take-up for policies that depend on SSN status—such as the Child Tax Credit (CTC)—and validating distributional impacts under reform scenarios. Most part of this implementation follows the methodology described in [Ryan (2022)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4662801)."

    "## Algorithm steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is implemented in the `add_ssn_card_type()` function. The algorithm assigns SSN card type codes based on immigration status: **Code 0** (`\"NONE\"`) for likely undocumented immigrants, **Code 1** (`\"CITIZEN\"`) for U.S. citizens (by birth or naturalization), **Code 2** (`\"NON_CITIZEN_VALID_EAD\"`) for non-citizens with work or study authorization, and **Code 3** (`\"OTHER_NON_CITIZEN\"`) for non-citizens with other indicators of legal status.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps explain how individuals are classified and assigned SSN card types based on citizenship, legal status indicators, and probabilistic adjustments to match population targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: citizen classification  \n",
    "Individuals are reassigned to Code 1 if they are identified as U.S. citizens based on their `PRCITSHP` value. Codes 1 through 4 capture all forms of U.S. citizenship, including native-born and naturalized citizens. Non-citizens (`PRCITSHP == 5`) are retained for further evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: ASEC undocumented algorithm conditions  \n",
    "The algorithm applies 14 sequential conditions, derived from the ASEC Undocumented Algorithm, to identify non-citizens with legal status indicators. These conditions rely on administrative data such as arrival year, program participation, and employment history. Individuals meeting any condition are reassigned to Code 2 (valid work/study authorization) or Code 3 (other legal status).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Condition 1*: Flags individuals who arrived before 1982 (`PEINUSYR` codes 1–7), a group eligible for IRCA amnesty.  \n",
    "- *Condition 2*: Identifies naturalized citizens (`PRCITSHP == 4`) who meet residency requirements—either 5+ years in the U.S. or 3+ years and married to a U.S. citizen.  \n",
    "- *Condition 3*: Reassigns individuals receiving Medicare (`MCARE == 1`), as eligibility implies legal status.  \n",
    "- *Condition 4*: Includes recipients of federal pensions (`PEN_SC1 == 3` or `PEN_SC2 == 3`), indicating lawful employment history.  \n",
    "- *Condition 5*: Captures those receiving Social Security Disability benefits (`RESNSS1 == 2` or `RESNSS2 == 2`).  \n",
    "- *Condition 6*: Identifies individuals with Indian Health Service coverage (`IHSFLG == 1`), indicating tribal affiliation or eligibility.  \n",
    "- *Condition 7*: Flags Medicaid recipients (`CAID == 1`), with the assumption that state-level restrictions are not modeled.  \n",
    "- *Condition 8*: Includes individuals with CHAMPVA health insurance (`CHAMPVA == 1`), which covers veterans’ families.  \n",
    "- *Condition 9*: Reassigns those with military health insurance (`MIL == 1`), such as TRICARE.  \n",
    "- *Condition 10*: Identifies government employees (`PEIO1COW` codes 1–3 or `A_MJOCC == 11`), assuming legal work authorization is required.  \n",
    "- *Condition 11*: Flags Social Security beneficiaries (`SS_YN == 1`).  \n",
    "- *Condition 12*: Uses housing subsidy participation (`SPM_CAPHOUSESUB > 0`, mapped from SPM units) as a legal status proxy.  \n",
    "- *Condition 13*: Identifies veterans or military personnel (`PEAFEVER == 1` or `A_MJOCC == 11`).  \n",
    "- *Condition 14*: Captures SSI recipients (`SSI_YN == 1`), assuming eligibility implies legal presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: target-driven EAD assignment for workers  \n",
    "To align with Pew Research estimates, the algorithm targets 8.3 million undocumented workers with valid employment authorization (EAD). Among non-citizens not already in Code 3, those with earnings (`WSAL_VAL > 0` or `SEMP_VAL > 0`) are eligible. The `select_random_subset_to_target()` function, seeded with 0, randomly assigns enough of these individuals to Code 2 to meet the employment-based target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: target-driven EAD assignment for students  \n",
    "A separate target is applied for undocumented students in higher education, estimated at roughly 399,000 (21% of 1.9 million, based on Higher Ed Immigration Portal data). Eligible individuals are non-citizens currently in college (`A_HSCOL == 2`) and not already in Code 3. A second call to `select_random_subset_to_target()` with seed 1 randomly reassigns the required number to Code 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: probabilistic family correlation adjustment  \n",
    "As a final step, the algorithm ensures the total undocumented population reaches the 13 million target. If needed, it uses a probabilistic adjustment to move some Code 3 household members to Code 0 within mixed-status families—households already containing Code 0 individuals. The function identifies these households, calculates the additional undocumented count needed, and randomly selects Code 3 members to reassign using a random seed of 100. This adjustment accounts for under-identification in prior steps and reflects real-world family compositions.\n",
