    "This document outlines an innovative approach for projecting federal income tax revenue through 2100 that uniquely combines sophisticated economic microsimulation with demographic reweighting. By harmonizing PolicyEngine's state-of-the-art tax modeling with Social Security Administration demographic projections, we can isolate and quantify the fiscal impact of population aging while preserving the full complexity of the tax code."

    "**Economic Evolution**: How incomes, prices, and tax parameters change over time\n",
    "- Wage growth and income distribution shifts\n",

    "#### Policy Analyzed\n",
    "The Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM) analyzed a policy proposal to permanently eliminate all income taxes on Social Security benefits, effective January 1, 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Budgetary Impact:** The policy is projected to reduce federal revenues by **$1.45 trillion** over the 10-year budget window (2025-2034). Over the long term, it is projected to increase federal debt by 7 percent by 2054, relative to the current baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Macroeconomic Impact:** The analysis finds the policy would have negative long-term effects on the economy.\n",
    "    * It reduces incentives for households to save for retirement and to work.\n",
    "    * This leads to a smaller capital stock (projected to be 4.2% lower by 2054).\n",
    "    * The smaller capital stock results in lower average wages (1.8% lower by 2054) and lower GDP (2.1% lower by 2054).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conventional Distributional Impact (Your Table):** The table you shared shows the annual \"conventional\" effects on household after-tax income.\n",
    "    * The largest average *dollar* tax cuts go to households in the top 20 percent of the income distribution (quintiles 80-100%).\n",
    "    * The largest *relative* gains (as a percentage of income) go to households in the fourth quintile (60-80%), who see a 1.6% increase in after-tax income by 2054.\n",
    "    * The dollar amounts shown are in **nominal dollars** for each specified year, not adjusted to a single base year.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dynamic (Lifetime) Impact:** When analyzing the policy's effects over a household's entire lifetime, PWBM finds:\n",
    "    * The policy primarily benefits high-income households who are nearing or in retirement.\n",
    "    * It negatively impacts all households under the age of 30 and all future generations, who would experience a net welfare loss due to the long-term effects of lower wages and higher federal debt."
