    "# Part I: ASEC Undocumented Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The ASEC Undocumented Algorithm implements a process of elimination approach to identify individuals who are likely undocumented immigrants by systematically removing people who have clear indicators of legal immigration status.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Paper**: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4662801\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm assigns SSN card type codes:\n",
    "- **Code 0**: `\"NONE\"` - Likely undocumented immigrants\n",
    "- **Code 1**: `\"CITIZEN\"` - US citizens (born or naturalized)  \n",
    "- **Code 2**: `\"NON_CITIZEN_VALID_EAD\"` - Non-citizens with work/study authorization\n",
    "- **Code 3**: `\"OTHER_NON_CITIZEN\"` - Non-citizens with indicators of legal status\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is implemented in the `add_ssn_card_type()` function in `policyengine_us_data/datasets/cps/cps.py:692-1350` (updated with comprehensive condition logging).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Parameters\n",
    "- `undocumented_target`: 13 million (default target for total undocumented population)\n",
    "- `undocumented_workers_target`: 8.3 million (target for undocumented workers)\n",
    "- `undocumented_students_target`: ~399k (21% of 1.9M total undocumented students)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recent Code Changes\n",
    "- **Step 6 Removal**: The algorithm now has 5 steps instead of 6\n",
    "- **Enhanced Logging**: All 14 individual ASEC conditions now log population counts to CSV\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Each condition prints console output and saves data for documentation"

    "## SSN Card Type Calibration in Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The ASEC undocumented algorithm is integrated into PolicyEngine's calibration system through the loss function in `policyengine_us_data/utils/loss.py`. This ensures that the simulated undocumented population matches external estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calibration Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibration system targets the `\"NONE\"` SSN card type (undocumented immigrants) using the following approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# SSN Card Type calibration\n",
    "for card_type_str in [\"NONE\"]:  # SSN card types as strings\n",
    "    ssn_type_mask = sim.calculate(\"ssn_card_type\").values == card_type_str\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Overall count by SSN card type\n",
    "    label = f\"ssa/ssn_card_type_{card_type_str.lower()}_count\"\n",

    "        ssn_type_mask, \"person\", \"household\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Population by Year\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    target_count = undocumented_targets[time_period]\n",

    "### Integration with Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibration target (13.0M for 2024) directly corresponds to the `undocumented_target` parameter in the `add_ssn_card_type()` function, ensuring consistency between the algorithm implementation and the broader PolicyEngine calibration framework.\n",

    "### Policy Context\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Running the Enhanced Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the CPS data generation process, the function will:\n",
    "1. Execute all algorithm steps (Steps 0-5) \n",
    "2. Print population numbers to console **for all 14 individual conditions**\n",
    "3. Save detailed population log to `docs/asec_population_log.csv` (replacing previous file)\n",
    "4. Display the CSV file path upon completion\n",
    "5. Automatically update this documentation with the latest numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enhanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**New in this version:**\n",
    "- ✅ All 14 ASEC conditions tracked individually\n",
    "- ✅ Complete population breakdown and analysis\n",
    "- ✅ CSV data includes every condition\n",
    "- ✅ Documentation shows detailed condition effectiveness\n",
    "- ✅ Console output for immediate feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Structure (Updated)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current 5-step algorithm:**\n",
    "- **Step 0**: Initialization (all start as Code 0)\n",
    "- **Step 1**: Citizen classification (move citizens to Code 1) \n",
    "- **Step 2**: ASEC conditions (move documented to Code 3) - **Now with full tracking**\n",
    "- **Step 3**: EAD workers (move some workers to Code 2)\n",
    "- **Step 4**: EAD students (move some students to Code 2)\n",
    "- **Step 5**: Probabilistic family correlation (final target adjustment)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Removed**: Step 6 (Final Population Targeting) - functionality moved to Step 5\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Run Complete Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure the Enhanced CPS 2024 dataset is generated\n",
    "2. Install required dependencies (`policyengine-us`, `policyengine-core`)\n",
    "3. Execute the notebook cells in order\n",
    "4. Review results from both algorithm execution and validation testing\n",
    "5. **New**: Analyze individual condition effectiveness using detailed breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Research Value**: Complete visibility into which legal status indicators are most common\n",
    "- **Algorithm Validation**: Verify each condition is working as expected\n",
    "- **Policy Analysis**: Understand how different legal status indicators affect population estimates\n",
    "- **Data Quality**: Full audit trail of all algorithm decisions and population movements\n",
    "\n",
    "The population numbers in this notebook are dynamically loaded from the CSV file and will always reflect the most recent algorithm run, **now including comprehensive tracking of all 14 individual ASEC conditions**."
