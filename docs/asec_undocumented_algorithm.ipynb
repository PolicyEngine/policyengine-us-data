    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm assigns SSN card type codes:\n",
    "- **Code 0**: `\"NONE\"` - Likely undocumented immigrants\n",
    "- **Code 1**: `\"CITIZEN\"` - US citizens (born or naturalized)  \n",
    "- **Code 2**: `\"NON_CITIZEN_VALID_EAD\"` - Non-citizens with work/study authorization\n",

    "## Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 0: Initialization\n",
    "- All persons start with SSN card type code 0 (`ssn_card_type = np.full(len(person), 0)`)\n",
    "- Prints initial Code 0 population count\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Citizen Classification\n",
    "Citizens are identified and moved to code 1 based on citizenship status:\n",
    "- **Condition**: `PRCITSHP` values 1, 2, 3, or 4 (all citizen types)\n",
    "- **Result**: Citizens assigned to code 1, non-citizens (`PRCITSHP == 5`) remain for further processing\n",

    "### Step 2: ASEC Undocumented Algorithm Conditions\n",
    "The algorithm applies 14 specific conditions to identify non-citizens with indicators of legal status. Only individuals not already classified as citizens (code 1) or authorized workers/students (code 2) are evaluated (`potentially_undocumented` mask).\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Condition 2: Eligible Naturalized Citizens\n",
    "- **Variables**: `PRCITSHP == 4` (naturalized citizen), `A_AGE >= 18`, `PEINUSYR` for residency\n",
    "- **Logic**: Naturalized citizens meeting residency requirements:\n",
    "  - 5+ years in US (codes 8-26: 1982-2019), OR\n",

    "#### Condition 8: CHAMPVA Recipients\n",
    "- **Variable**: `CHAMPVA == 1`\n",
    "- **Logic**: CHAMPVA (Veterans Affairs health coverage) indicates military family connection\n",

    "#### Condition 13: Veterans/Military Personnel\n",
    "- **Variables**: `PEAFEVER == 1` OR `A_MJOCC == 11`\n",

    "- **Logic**: If any household member has code 0 (undocumented), all other eligible household members are also assigned code 0\n",
    "- **Scope**: Only affects people with codes 0 or 3 (not citizens or EAD holders)\n",
    "- **Process**: \n",
    "  1. Iterate through each unique household ID\n",
    "  2. Check if household has any code 0 members\n",
