Our approach uses\nquantile regression forests to impute 67 tax variables from the PUF onto CPS records,\npreserving distributional characteristics while maintaining household composition and member\nrelationships. The imputation process alone does not guarantee consistency with official\nstatistics, necessitating a reweighting step to align the combined dataset with known\npopulation totals and administrative benchmarks. We apply a reweighting algorithm that\ncalibrates the dataset to 2,813 targets from\nthe IRS Statistics of Income, Census population projections, Congressional Budget\nOffice benefit program estimates, Treasury\nexpenditure data, Joint Committee on Taxation tax expenditure estimates, healthcare\nspending patterns, and other benefit program costs. The reweighting employs dropout-regularized\ngradient descent optimization\nto ensure consistency with administrative benchmarks. Validation shows the enhanced dataset\nreduces error in key tax components by [TO BE CALCULATED]% relative to the baseline CPS.\nThe dataset maintains the CPS’s demographic detail and geographic granularity while\nincorporating tax reporting data from administrative sources. We release the enhanced\ndataset, source code, and documentation to support policy analysis.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":1}},"key":"UGxPcDpjXR"}],"key":"T3kyPaGC6d"}],"key":"ShmaPREjI1"}],"key":"WlN8qJLCgc"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}},"footer":{"navigation":{"next":{"title":"Introduction","url":"/introduction","group":"PolicyEngine US Data"}}},"domain":"http://localhost:3000"}
