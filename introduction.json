First, we employ quantile regression forests to preserve distributional characteristics during imputation, improving upon traditional hot-deck and regression-based methods that may distort variable relationships.

Second, we calibrate to 2,813 targets from multiple administrative sources, far exceeding the scope of previous calibration efforts which typically use fewer than 100 targets.

Methodologically, we demonstrate how quantile regression forests can effectively impute detailed tax variables while preserving their joint distribution and relationship to demographics. This advances the statistical matching literature by showing how modern machine learning methods can overcome limitations of traditional hot-deck and parametric approaches. The preservation of distributional characteristics is particularly important for tax policy analysis where outcomes often depend on complex interactions between income sources and household characteristics.","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":1},"end":{"line":21,"column":1}},"key":"lFnl5sovkx"}],"key":"NuT7geilmF"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":1},"end":{"line":23,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Our empirical contribution involves creating and validating a publicly available enhanced dataset that addresses longstanding data limitations in microsimulation modeling.
