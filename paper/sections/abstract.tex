\section*{Abstract}

We present a novel methodology for creating enhanced microsimulation datasets by combining the demographic richness of the Current Population Survey (CPS) with the tax precision of the IRS Public Use File (PUF). Our two-stage approach first uses quantile regression forests to impute 72 detailed tax variables from the PUF onto CPS records, preserving distributional characteristics while maintaining household structure. We then apply a sophisticated reweighting algorithm that calibrates the enhanced dataset to over 7,000 targets from six authoritative sources: IRS Statistics of Income, Census population projections, Congressional Budget Office program estimates, Treasury expenditure data, Joint Committee on Taxation tax expenditure estimates, and healthcare spending patterns. The reweighting employs dropout-regularized gradient descent optimization to avoid overfitting while ensuring consistency with administrative benchmarks. Validation against official statistics shows the Enhanced CPS outperforms the baseline CPS in 73\% of targets and the PUF in 66\% of targets, with particularly strong improvements in income distribution metrics and program participation rates. The resulting dataset maintains the CPS's demographic detail and geographic granularity while achieving tax reporting accuracy comparable to administrative data, providing a robust foundation for analyzing both tax and transfer policies. We release the enhanced dataset, source code, and detailed documentation to support reproducible policy analysis.
