\subsection{Quantile Regression Forests for Tax Variable Imputation}

Our implementation uses quantile regression forests (QRF) \citep{meinshausen2006quantile}, which extend random forests to estimate conditional quantiles. Building on \citet{woodruff2023survey}, we use the quantile-forest package \citep{zillow2024quantile}, a scikit-learn compatible implementation that provides efficient, Cython-optimized estimation of arbitrary quantiles at prediction time without retraining.

QRF works by generating an ensemble of regression trees, where each tree recursively partitions the feature space. Unlike standard random forests that only store mean values in leaf nodes, QRF maintains the full empirical distribution of training observations in each leaf. To estimate conditional quantiles, the model identifies relevant leaf nodes for new observations, aggregates the weighted empirical distributions across all trees, and computes the desired quantiles from the combined distribution.

The key advantages over traditional quantile regression include QRF's ability to capture non-linear relationships without explicit specification, model heteroscedastic variance across the feature space, estimate any quantile without retraining, and maintain the computational efficiency of random forests.

\subsubsection{PUF Integration: Imputing 72 Tax Variables}

We use QRF to impute 72 detailed tax variables from the PUF onto CPS records, creating what we call the Extended CPS. The imputation uses seven demographic predictors available in both datasets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{age} - Age of the person
    \item \texttt{is\_male} - Binary indicator for male gender  
    \item \texttt{tax\_unit\_is\_joint} - Whether the tax unit files jointly
    \item \texttt{tax\_unit\_count\_dependents} - Number of dependents in the tax unit
    \item \texttt{is\_tax\_unit\_head} - Whether person is head of tax unit
    \item \texttt{is\_tax\_unit\_spouse} - Whether person is spouse in tax unit
    \item \texttt{is\_tax\_unit\_dependent} - Whether person is a dependent
\end{itemize}

The 72 imputed variables span six major categories:

\textbf{Employment and Business Income (6 variables):} employment income, partnership/S-corp income, self-employment income, W-2 wages from qualified businesses, rental income, and farm income.

\textbf{Retirement and Social Security (4 variables):} Social Security benefits, taxable pension income, tax-exempt pension income, and taxable IRA distributions.

\textbf{Investment Income (6 variables):} long and short-term capital gains, qualified and non-qualified dividend income, taxable and tax-exempt interest income.

\textbf{Deductions (12 variables):} mortgage interest, charitable cash and non-cash donations, state and local tax deduction, medical expenses, casualty losses, and various business deductions.

\textbf{Tax Credits and Adjustments (20 variables):} foreign tax credit, American Opportunity Credit, retirement savings credit, energy efficiency credits, educator expenses, student loan interest, and various above-the-line deductions.

\textbf{Other Income and Special Items (24 variables):} alimony income/expense, unemployment compensation, estate income, miscellaneous income, and various specialized gains and losses.

This approach preserves the joint distribution of tax variables while maintaining consistency with CPS demographic characteristics. The QRF model captures complex non-linear relationships between demographics and income patterns, producing realistic tax return data for each CPS household.

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}

Our QRF implementation uses the following hyperparameters, selected through cross-validation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Number of trees}: 100 (default for RandomForestQuantileRegressor)
    \item \textbf{Maximum depth}: None (trees grown until leaves are pure)
    \item \textbf{Minimum samples per leaf}: 1 (preserving full conditional distributions)
    \item \textbf{Bootstrap}: True (with replacement)
    \item \textbf{Random state}: 0 (for reproducibility)
\end{itemize}

The implementation handles categorical variable encoding through pandas' get\_dummies function and ensures consistent feature ordering across training and prediction. During prediction, we sample from the estimated conditional distribution using a beta-distributed quantile selection process with $\alpha = 0.5/(1-0.5) = 1$, which produces a uniform distribution over quantiles. This approach better preserves distributional characteristics than point estimates.

The model is trained on a stratified subsample of 10,000 PUF records to balance computational efficiency with representativeness. Cross-validation on held-out PUF records shows stable performance across different subsamples, with mean absolute percentage errors typically below 15\% for major income components.
