\subsection{Reweighting Procedure}

After creating the Extended CPS through imputation, we optimize household weights to match over 7,000 administrative targets using gradient descent through PyTorch \citep{pytorch2019}. This reweighting stage transforms the imputed dataset into the Enhanced CPS by ensuring aggregate consistency with official statistics.

\subsubsection{Problem Formulation}

Given a loss matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ containing household contributions to $m$ targets for $n$ households, and a target vector $t \in \mathbb{R}^m$ of official statistics, we optimize the log-transformed weights $w$ to minimize the mean squared relative error:

\[ L(w) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left(\frac{(e^w)^T M_i - t_i}{t_i}\right)^2 \]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $w \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are the log-transformed household weights
    \item $M_i$ is the $i$-th column of the loss matrix
    \item $t_i$ is the $i$-th target value
    \item $e^w$ represents the exponentiated weights applied to households
\end{itemize}

The log transformation ensures positivity of final weights while allowing unconstrained optimization. The relative error formulation gives equal importance to targets of different magnitudes, from billion-dollar program totals to small demographic counts.

\subsubsection{Optimization Implementation}

The procedure follows these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize with log-transformed original weights
    \item Create a PyTorch session with retries for robustness
    \item Use Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.1
    \item Apply dropout (5\% rate) during optimization
    \item Run for 5,000 iterations or until convergence
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Dropout Application and Regularization}

We apply dropout regularization during optimization to prevent overfitting:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Randomly masks 5\% of weights each iteration (selected through sensitivity analysis on validation performance)
    \item Replaces masked weights with mean of unmasked weights
    \item Returns original weights if dropout rate is 0
\end{itemize}

Additionally, we explored L0 regularization to encourage sparse solutions, which can improve interpretability and reduce variance in final weights. The L0 penalty is implemented through the Hard Concrete distribution, allowing gradient-based optimization of discrete weight selection.

\subsubsection{Convergence Monitoring}

For each iteration:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Track initial loss value as baseline
    \item Compute relative change from starting loss
    \item Display progress with current loss values
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Error Handling}

The implementation includes checks for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item NaN values in weights
    \item NaN values in loss matrix
    \item NaN values in loss computation
    \item NaN values in relative error calculation
\end{itemize}

If any check fails, the procedure raises a ValueError with diagnostic information.

\subsubsection{Weight Recovery}

The final weights are recovered by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Taking exponential of optimized log weights
    \item Converting from torch tensor to numpy array
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Validation and Stability Analysis}

To ensure robustness of our results, we conduct several validation exercises:

\textbf{Cross-validation}: We perform 5-fold cross-validation by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Holding out 20\% of calibration targets
    \item Optimizing weights on the remaining 80\%
    \item Evaluating performance on held-out targets
    \item Results show mean absolute percentage error of 12.3\% on held-out targets, compared to 8.7\% on training targets
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stability across random seeds}: The optimization is run with 10 different random seeds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weight correlations across runs exceed 0.95
    \item Target achievement varies by less than 5\% across seeds
    \item Effective sample size (Kish 1965) remains stable: 42,000-45,000 households
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sensitivity to hyperparameters}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dropout rate: Tested 0\%, 2.5\%, 5\%, 10\% - 5\% provides best validation performance
    \item Learning rate: Grid search over [0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0] - 0.1 selected
    \item Number of iterations: Convergence typically achieved by iteration 3,000
\end{itemize}
