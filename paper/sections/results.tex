\section{Results}

We validate our enhanced dataset against a comprehensive set of official statistics and compare its performance to both the original CPS and PUF datasets. Our validation metrics cover over 7,000 distinct targets spanning demographic totals, program participation rates, and detailed income components across the distribution.

\subsection{Validation Against Administrative Totals}

The enhanced CPS (ECPS) is validated against over 7,000 administrative targets. The enhancement methodology aims to combine the strengths of both source datasets - the CPS's demographic representation and the PUF's tax precision. Detailed validation results are available in our online dashboard at \url{https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/validation.html}.

\subsection{Target Category Performance}

The enhanced dataset is calibrated to various categories of targets:

\textbf{IRS Income Components:} AGI-stratified income targets including employment income, capital gains, partnership and S-corp income, and dividend income.

\textbf{Program Participation:} CBO projections for SNAP benefits, Social Security, unemployment compensation, and income tax revenue.

\textbf{Demographic Targets:} Population by single year of age, state populations, and healthcare spending by age group.

\textbf{Tax Expenditures:} JCT estimates for SALT deduction (\$21.2B), charitable deduction (\$65.3B), mortgage interest (\$24.8B), and medical expense deduction (\$11.4B).

\subsection{Income Distribution}

Table \ref{tab:tax_unit_metrics} compares distributional statistics across all three datasets, measuring net income after taxes and transfers at the tax unit level without equivalization:

\input{tables/tax_unit_metrics}

The enhanced CPS achieves very similar distributional statistics to the PUF, with a Gini coefficient of 0.572 compared to 0.570 in the PUF, and nearly identical top income shares. This suggests our enhancement procedure successfully incorporates the PUF's more accurate representation of the income distribution. 

For applications requiring household-level analysis, Table \ref{tab:household_metrics} shows these same metrics calculated over households rather than tax units:

\input{tables/household_metrics}

The household-level metrics show similar patterns of increased inequality capture compared to the baseline CPS, though the magnitudes differ due to the different unit of analysis.

\subsection{Poverty Measurement}

The poverty metrics in Table \ref{tab:poverty_metrics} warrant particular attention:

\input{tables/poverty_metrics}

The poverty metrics shown in Table \ref{tab:poverty_metrics} require further investigation in future work. The differences between datasets may reflect various factors including the imputation methodology, reweighting process, and the interaction between tax variables and poverty measurement. Users analyzing poverty should interpret results cautiously and may wish to compare results across different weight specifications.

\subsection{Weight Distribution Analysis}

The weight distribution statistics shown in Table \ref{tab:weight_stats} reveal notable differences in how the datasets represent the population. Note that CPS and enhanced CPS values reflect household weights, while PUF values reflect tax unit weights:

\input{tables/weight_stats}

The weight distribution statistics reflect the different sampling designs of each dataset. The enhanced CPS exhibits different weight patterns due to the combination of CPS and PUF records through the imputation and reweighting process.

A detailed, interactive validation dashboard showing performance across all targets is maintained at \url{https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/validation.html} and updates automatically with each dataset revision. This transparency allows users to assess the dataset's strengths and limitations for their specific use cases.

\subsection{Example Policy Reform: Top Tax Rate Increase}

To demonstrate the enhanced dataset's value for policy analysis, we examine President Biden's 2025 budget proposal to raise the top marginal income tax rate from 37\% to 39.6\%. This would restore the pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act rate for high-income taxpayers, applying to income above \$400,000 for single filers, \$425,000 for head of household filers, \$450,000 for married joint filers, and \$225,000 for married separate filers, with thresholds indexed to inflation from 2025.

Table \ref{tab:top_rate_reform} compares revenue projections across datasets:

\input{tables/top_rate_reform}

Table \ref{tab:top_rate_reform} presents revenue projections from this reform across the three datasets. The differences in projections illustrate how the enhanced dataset's incorporation of PUF tax data affects modeling of policies targeting high-income households.
